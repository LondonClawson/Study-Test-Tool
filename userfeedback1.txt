[DONE] Answers need to be able to wrap text (some answers are long and go off screen and I cant read them)

I would like to be able to have a test that is a ransom selection from several different tests that I have setup (I have 4 weeks of tests for a class that I have been working on a week at a time but now I need to prep for the mid-term and its all 4 weeks. I want to get maybe 10 questions selected accross all of the tests that I select to be put into a test, if the analitics could still identify my pass rate for the origin test that would be nice)

[DONE] It would be nice if the tests could be organized (sort the tests by name, creation date, etc... Possibly group them as well, class, cert, etc...)

[DONE] Questions should have a warning flagg or give some kind of feedback if there is no answer set.

[DONE] When updating questions there should be an "You have unsaved changes are you sure you want to close/move off" type of popup if I forget to save a change.

[DONE] If the question text is too long I need to be able to scroll, this is critical!!! I had a long question that pushed the buttons down below the bottom of my screen completly preventing me from moving off of the quesiton.

[DONE] It would be nice if there was an export test feature (shareing my tests, making sure that every quesiton has an answer and that the answers are correct, etc...)

It would be nice to be able to import tests from PDF
