1. Open Terminal (Cmd+Space, type "Terminal")
  2. Paste this one line:
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LondonClawson/Study-Test-Tool/main/study_test_tool/scripts/install.sh)"
  3. Wait for it to finish, close Terminal

  From then on:
  - "Study Test Tool" app sits on her Desktop — double-click to open, like any app
  - It silently pulls your latest code each launch
  - No Terminal window, no updates to manage
