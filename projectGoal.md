Project Goal
This project will be built in python.

We are going to build a tool that will allow the user to take simple tests that they import into it.
This needs to run on a mac
this needs to have a gui

MVP
this needs to display the question and a list of multiple choice/essay questions.
the user will take the test, checking the boxes or writing out there answers. at the end the program will compair there answers to the correct answers provided and give the user there score (both #/# and %) essay answers will simply print the users input and the expected output and the user will evaluate if its close enough at the end. 
the program should allow the user to see the questions they got right/wrong so they know where they need to improve.
the program should record each test result so that the user can see there score over time. 
the program should allow the user to add more questions to a test (before the test starts the user should be able to edit the test and input more questions/answers then it will be included in that test)
the program should be able to handle multiple different tests not just one (math, english, history each could have there own test not all questions are in a central pool)
the user should be able to select the test they want to take. 
there should be a timer so that the user can track the amount of time it takes to finish the test. 
the user should be able to flag a question for review later so that they can move on and come back if needed.
the questions should be presented in a random order.
the answers should be presented in a random order (option A. should not always be the same (you shouldnt be able to memorize 'A' was the answer to this question))


Phase 1 (Core Learning):
Practice mode with immediate feedback
Missed questions review mode
Performance graphs over time
Weak topic identification

Phase 2 (Engagement):
Achievement system
Study streak tracking
Note-taking per question
Custom test builder

Phase 3 (Advanced):
Spaced repetition algorithm
Explanations for answers
Study session planner

NICE TO HAVE POST MVP
Feature Enhancements for Better Learning
Analytics & Progress Tracking
Performance trends graphs - visualize score improvement over time
Weak topic identification - highlight categories/topics with lowest scores
Time-per-question analytics - identify questions that slow them down
Streak tracking - consecutive days studied, tests taken
Accuracy rate per question - see which specific questions trip them up repeatedly
Best/worst time of day - when do they score highest?

Smart Study Features
Spaced repetition mode - show questions they got wrong more frequently
Practice mode vs Test mode - practice mode shows correct answer immediately
Missed questions review - dedicated mode to only retry previously missed questions
Confidence rating - let users rate how confident they were (even if correct)

Study Tools
Note-taking per question - jot down why they missed something
Flashcard generation - auto-create flashcards from missed questions
Print study guide - export weak areas as PDF
Cram mode - rapid-fire questions, minimal UI

Backup/restore - save all progress and tests

UX Improvements
Dark mode - easier on eyes during long study sessions
Font size adjustment - accessibility
Keyboard shortcuts - navigate without mouse (A/B/C/D for answers, N for next)
Progress indicator during test - "Question 5 of 20"
Bookmarks/favorites - mark important tests
Search functionality - find tests or specific questions quickly

Smart Notifications
Study reminders - "You haven't practiced in 3 days"
Review alerts - "Time to review your weak topics"
Goal notifications - "You're 2 tests away from your weekly goal!"

Advanced Analytics
Learning curve visualization - are they improving?
Compare tests - "Math vs History performance"
Time investment - total time spent per subject
Predicted readiness - "Based on your scores, you might need more practice"
