1. A 14-year-old was the youngest licensed pilot in the state. On a foggy day when pilots were being advised to fly only if necessary, the pilot took his plane out so that he could fly low over the football field where his friends were practicing. When he attempted to land on his return to the airport, he ran off the runway due to the fog and damaged an executive's airplane, which was in the parking area. If the executive sues the pilot for damage to his airplane and prevails, what is the likely reason?

a. A reasonable pilot would not have flown that day. -- correct 

b. A pilot with the same age, education, intelligence, and experience would not have flown that day.

c. It was not necessary for the pilot to fly that day.

d. The flying of a plane by a 14-year-old is an inherently dangerous activity, and the pilot is strictly liable for the damage.

2. A hiker in an isolated area encountered a cross-country skier who had broken her leg. The hiker created a makeshift sled and began pulling the skier to the nearest road. As the hiker was pulling her across the ice of a lake, the ice gave way and they went into the water. The hiker was unable to get out of the water and drowned. The skier was able to pull herself to shore and eventually was rescued. However, she suffered severe hypothermia and lost some of her toes to frostbite as a result of being in the water. Does the skier have a cause of action for damages against the hiker's estate?

a. No, because the hiker had no duty to come to the skier's aid.

b. No, because the hiker did not survive the accident.

C. No, unless the hiker acted negligently in attempting to cross the ice. -- correct

d. No, unless the hiker acted with gross negligence in his attempt to cross the ice.

3. A teenager and his father were practicing baseball in a sandlot when the teenager hit the ball over his father's head and onto a landowner's adjacent property. The landowner had several "beware of dog" signs posted along his fence, but the father did not notice them in his haste to retrieve the ball. The father climbed over the fence into the landowner's yard and was attacked by the landowner's vicious guard dog, which was trained to baim intruders. The dog bit the father, causing him to suffer severe lacerations that required numerous stitches. If the father brings an action against the landowner to recover damages for his injuries, will he likely prevail?

a. Yes, because the landowner may not use a vicious dog to protect only his
property. -- correct

b. Yes, because the landowner is strictly liable for injuries caused by the vicious dog. ☑☑ No, because the father was trespassing on the landowner's property.

d. No, because the landowner had posted signs warning about the dog.

A woman possessed extraordinary strength but significantly below-average intelligence. The woman worked at a job that required her to manually unload very heavy pipes from a delivery truck.

Which of the following best describes the standard of care that the woman owes to people who could foreseeably be injured if she were negligent in the performance of this work?

a. The care that would be used by a reasonable, prudent person of average strength and intelligence.

5. A store advertised a sale in which a much-anticipated new gaming system would be sold the day before the system was scheduled to be released elsewhere, and at half its regular price, to the first 50 shoppers who checked out that day. On the day of the sale, there were hundreds of people waiting for the store to open, and when the doors opened, the shoppers all ran to the electronics department in an effort to get the gaming system and be one of the first 50 shoppers to buy it. One of the shoppers was injured in the rush of people. In a subsequent action by the shopper against the store, the store introduced evidence that this kind of sale was widely offered by retail stores throughout the county, and that the store had followed all the security procedures generally employed for these types of sales.

What effect will this evidence have on the court's instructions to the jury regarding the standard of care?

a. The jury will be instructed that the evidence of procedures and custom is irrelevant to the standard of care.

b. The jury will be instructed that it should consider the evidence of procedures and custom to esutblish the standard of care. --already establishech

The salesperson threatened to send a text communicating a very embarrassing--and potentially career-ending--fact about the rival to a number of executives at their company. The salesperson started texting. The rival grab the believed that the only way she could prevent the salesperson from sending the text was to The salesperson was startled by this act of aggression and believed that she was under attack. The salesperson picked up a chair and hit the rival on the head so hard that the rival sustained a concussion. The salesperson started to raise the chair a second time, prompting the rival, fearful for her life, to push the salesperson, who fell and broke her arm. The rival subsequently sued the salesperson for battery, and the salesperson counter-sued the rival for battery as well.

7. A man went for a walk in the countryside on a sunny day, wearing an expensive new suede jacket. Suddenly dark clouds rolled in, and it was apparent that it would soon start to rain. Needing to protect his expensive suede jacket, which would have been ruined if it got wet, the man ran up to the nearest house and saw that the garage door was slightly open. He lifted the door and went inside to wait for the rain to end. The owner of the house discovered the man in the garage, and although the man did not damage anything in the garage, the owner brought an action against him for trespass.

Assuming that the elements of trespass are satisfied, is the man likely to be successful in asserting a defense of private necessity?

a. Yes, because the storm was an unforeseeable act of God.

b. Yes, because the man did not harm anything in the owner's garage, but the storm would have ruined the man's jacket.

C. No, because a reasonable person would not likely believe that damage to an expensive jacket is a substantially greater harm than interference with another's property rights. -- correct


d. No, because the defense of private necessity is only available where the defendant was threatened with physical harm rather than property damage.

8. A sudden breach in a dam caused rapid, severe flooding in a nearby city. In an attempt to help people evacuate, an off-duty police officer directed vehicles through a farmer's private property to a highway without the farmer's consent. The vehicles did significant damage to the farmer's land and crops.

In a subsequent action by the farmer against the officer for trespass, what is the best argument in defense?

a. The officer reasonably believed that the potential harm from the flood to each of the individual citizens who drove over the farmer's property was substantially greater than the harm done to the farmer's property and crops.

b) The officer reasonably believed that the use of the farmer's property was necessary to avert an imminent public disaster. -- correct

c. The officer did not foresee that the use of the farmer's property would cause as much damage as it did.

d. No one could have foreseen, under the circumstances of the imminent public disaster, that the use of the farmer's property would cause as much damage as it did.
